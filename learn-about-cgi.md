# About CGI

- Common gateway interface (CGI)
- A standard way for web servers to handle web forms using CGI scripts
- A CGI script:
    1. Reads the form input
    2. Generate a response based on given input data
    3. Write response to STDOUT
- To develop a CGI-script, just write a program that does the above and
  place it in the `cgi-bin` directory.
- CGI is has performance, security issues but it is really simple to
  develop.

**Sample CGI Script**

Call the script below via `http://example.com/printenv.pl`
```
    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    =head1 DESCRIPTION

    printenv â€” a CGI program that just prints its environment

    =cut
    print "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n";

    for my $var ( sort keys %ENV ) {
        printf "%s=\"%s\"\n", $var, $ENV{$var};
    }
```
